# Day 14 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 18th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. **Continued my 60DaysOfCode challenge** and updated today’s progress on GitHub.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder (`construct_tree_in_post.cpp`) → built a binary tree using inorder and postorder traversal arrays.  
   - Convert Sorted Array to Balanced BST (`sorted_array_to_bst.cpp`) → created a height-balanced BST from a sorted array.  
   - Construct Maximum Binary Tree (`maximum_binary_tree.cpp`) → built a binary tree where each node is the maximum in its subtree.  
3. **Created Python utility scripts** (optional) to help automate documentation or practice logging.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced **binary tree construction techniques** using different traversal orders.  
- Improved understanding of **recursion, divide-and-conquer, and tree properties**.  
- Learned to handle **index mapping** efficiently to optimize tree construction.  
- Strengthened **problem-solving and debugging skills** in C++.

## Next Steps

- Solve **more complex tree and graph problems** tomorrow.  
- Implement **traversals, searches, and tree manipulations** in different variations.  
- Continue maintaining **daily logs and notes** to track progress.
