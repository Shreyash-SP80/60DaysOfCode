## ðŸ“Œ What I Did Today

1. **Stayed consistent** with my 60DaysOfCode journey and made multiple commits throughout the day.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Find Maximum in Array (`find_max.cpp`) â†’ found the largest element in an array using iteration.  
   - Check Prime (`is_prime.cpp`) â†’ checked whether a given number is prime or not.  
   - Factorial of a Number (`factorial.cpp`) â†’ calculated factorial using both iterative and recursive approaches.  
3. **Created a Python script** â€“ *File Sorter (`file_sorter.py`)* that organizes files in a folder by type.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Learned how to use **loops and conditionals** effectively for problem-solving.  
- Practiced writing **clean, modular code** for reusability and better readability.  
- Understood how to work with **file handling and directory management** in Python.  
- Realized that automating small tasks can **save time** and make workflow efficient.

## âœ… Next Steps

- Practice 2â€“3 more DSA problems involving **arrays and strings**.  
- Enhance the File Sorter script (add more file type categories).  
- Push daily commits early to maintain streak consistency.
