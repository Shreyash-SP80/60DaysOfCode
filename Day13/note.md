# ðŸ“˜ Day 13 Notes â€” DSA Practice

## âœ… Problems Solved
1. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
2. Check if Two Binary Trees are Same
3. Check if Binary Tree is Symmetric

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts Learned
- Binary Tree traversal and construction logic  
- Recursive approach for comparing and mirroring trees  
- Use of `unordered_map` for fast lookup in inorder traversal  
- Understanding of symmetry and reflection in binary structures  

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway
Recursion and understanding of traversal orders are crucial for mastering binary tree problems.
Focus on the base and recursive cases clearly.
