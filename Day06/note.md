# Day 06 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 8th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. **Continued my 60DaysOfCode challenge** and pushed today’s progress to GitHub.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Find Maximum and Minimum in Array (`max_min_array.cpp`) → found both values using linear traversal.  
   - Check Palindrome Number (`palindrome_number.cpp`) → checked if a number reads the same backward and forward.  
   - Merge Two Sorted Arrays (`merge_sorted_arrays.cpp`) → merged arrays without using extra space efficiently.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *Word Frequency Counter (`word_frequency_counter.py`)* to analyze text and display the most common words from user input or a file.

## Key Learnings

- Enhanced understanding of **array operations** and **logic optimization** in C++.  
- Practiced **file handling and text processing** in Python.  
- Learned how to handle **PDF text extraction** using the `PyPDF2` library.  
- Improved knowledge of **data counting** using Python’s `collections.Counter`.  
- Understood how to **handle encoding errors** and safely read files.

## Next Steps

- Solve **pattern and recursion-based problems** tomorrow in C++.  
- Enhance the Word Frequency Counter to **ignore stopwords** and **visualize word counts** using charts.  
- Continue making **daily commits** and updating my progress documentation.
