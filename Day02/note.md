# ðŸš€ Day 02 â€“ 60DaysOfCode

## ðŸ“… Date: 4th October 2025

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did Today

1. **Continued my 60DaysOfCode challenge** â€“ stayed consistent and pushed multiple commits.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Two Sum (`two_sum.cpp`) â†’ found two indices whose numbers add up to the target.  
   - Count Digits (`count_digits.cpp`) â†’ calculated the number of digits in a given integer.  
   - Reverse Integer (`reverse_integer.cpp`) â†’ reversed the digits of an integer while handling negatives.  
3. Gained more confidence with **loops, condition checks, and number operations**.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Practiced **array traversal** and using maps for the Two Sum problem.  
- Strengthened logic on **mathematical operations** (modulus, division).  
- Understood **edge cases** like negative numbers and integer overflow in Reverse Integer.  
- Realized the importance of breaking problems into **small steps** before coding.

## âœ… Next Steps

- Continue solving more DSA problems tomorrow.  
- Add small improvements to my scripts (make them more dynamic).  
- Keep documenting daily progress clearly in notes and README.
