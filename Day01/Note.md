# ðŸš€ Day 01 â€“ 365DaysOfCode

## ðŸ“… Date: 3rd October 2025

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did Today

1. **Started my 60DaysOfCode challenge** â€“ goal is to commit daily and improve my coding skills.  
2. **Solved a Linear Search problem**  in C++:
   - Implemented a function to return the index of a target from array.
   - If the target is not found, returns -1.
3. **Practiced basic DSA problems**:
   - Palindrome number check (`palindrome_number.cpp`)
   - Reverse String (`reverse_string.cpp`)
5. **Experimented with a small script** â€“ file renamer in Python (`file_renamer.py`).

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Learned how **linear search** works in detail  
- Practiced **modular coding** by separating DSA problems into individual files.  
- Understood the importance of **daily commits** to maintain consistency and track progress. 
- Started thinking about **project structure**, dividing mini projects and scripts into separate folders.

## âœ… Next Steps

- Solve **more DSA problems** tomorrow.  
- Experiment with **another mini script**.  
- Keep track of commits and progress in the **root README**.
