## What I Did Today

1. Continued progressing in my 60DaysOfCode challenge.  
2. Solved Linked List problems in C++ to strengthen pointer handling and memory management:
   - 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs → Swapped every two adjacent nodes without changing values using pointer manipulation.  
     File: `swap_nodes_pairs.cpp`
   - 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List → Removed adjacent duplicates efficiently in a sorted linked list.  
     File: `remove_duplicates_ll.cpp`
3. Created a Python automation script to compile and run C++ files automatically.  
   File: `run_cpp.py`

## Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of pointer manipulation in linked lists.  
- Learned how dummy nodes simplify edge cases in linked list operations.  
- Practiced writing clean and efficient solutions for in-place modifications.  
- Built a Python script that automates:
  - Compiling C++ code  
  - Executing output  
  - Printing errors clearly  
- Boosted productivity with automation and clean coding habits.

## Code Files Overview

| Language | File Name | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| C++ | `swap_nodes_pairs.cpp` | Swaps adjacent nodes in a linked list (Problem 24) |
| C++ | `remove_duplicates_ll.cpp` | Removes duplicates from a sorted linked list (Problem 83) |
| Python | `run_cpp.py` | Automates compiling and running C++ programs |

## Next Steps

- Solve more Linked List problems (reverse list, K-group swaps, cycle detection).  
- Implement custom linked list utility functions for faster debugging.  
- Expand the Python automation script to:
  - Track execution time  
  - Watch file changes (auto-run on save)  
  - Manage multiple C++ test files
