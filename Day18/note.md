## What I Did Today

1. Continued progressing in my 60DaysOfCode challenge.  
2. Solved Linked List problems in C++ to strengthen pointer handling and memory management:
   - 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs → Swapped every two adjacent nodes without changing values using pointer manipulation.  
     File: `swap_nodes_pairs.cpp`
   - 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List → Removed adjacent duplicates efficiently in a sorted linked list.  
     File: `remove_duplicates_ll.cpp`
3. Created a Python automation script to compile and run C++ files automatically.  
   File: `run_cpp.py`
