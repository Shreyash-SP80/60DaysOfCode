## ðŸ“Œ What I Did Today

1. **Maintained consistency** with my 60DaysOfCode journey and made multiple commits throughout the day.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Armstrong Number (`armstrong_number.cpp`) â†’ checked whether a number is an Armstrong number.  
   - Perfect Number (`perfect_number.cpp`) â†’ verified if a number is perfect by summing its proper divisors.  
   - Strong Number (`strong_number.cpp`) â†’ determined if a number is strong by comparing the sum of factorial of digits with the number itself.  
3. **Created a Python script** â€“ *Simple To-Do List (`todo_list.py`)* to manage tasks from the command line.
