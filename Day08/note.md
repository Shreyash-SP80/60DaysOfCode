## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** with focus on improving **string manipulation and logical thinking**.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Remove Duplicates from String (`remove_duplicates.cpp`) → removed duplicate characters while preserving the original order.  
   - Count Characters in String (`count_characters.cpp`) → counted the frequency of each character efficiently using arrays.  
   - Check Anagram (`anagram_check.cpp`) → verified whether two strings are anagrams using sorting and comparison logic.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *File Size Checker (`file_size_checker.py`)* that scans a directory, displays file sizes, and identifies the largest file.
