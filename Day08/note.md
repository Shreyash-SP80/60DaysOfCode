# Day 08 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 10th October 2025

## What I Did Today 

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** with focus on improving **string manipulation and logical thinking**.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Remove Duplicates from String (`remove_duplicates.cpp`) → removed duplicate characters while preserving the original order.  
   - Count Characters in String (`count_characters.cpp`) → counted the frequency of each character efficiently using arrays.  
   - Check Anagram (`anagram_check.cpp`) → verified whether two strings are anagrams using sorting and comparison logic.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *File Size Checker (`file_size_checker.py`)* that scans a directory, displays file sizes, and identifies the largest file.

---

## Key Learnings

- Enhanced understanding of **string traversal, frequency counting, and data comparison** in C++.  
- Learned different ways to **manipulate and clean strings** effectively.  
- Practiced **sorting algorithms and character mapping** for anagram detection.  
- Gained deeper insights into **file handling and automation** in Python.  
- Strengthened daily habit of **problem-solving and clean code writing**.

## Next Steps

- Move on to **pattern printing and recursion-based problems** tomorrow.  
- Add a feature in the File Size Checker to **export results into a text or CSV file**.  
- Continue making **daily commits** and refine overall project documentation.
