# Day 05 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 7th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. **Continued my 60DaysOfCode challenge** and made multiple commits to maintain consistency.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Reverse Array (`reverse_array.cpp`) → reversed an array in place using two pointers.  
   - Count Vowels in a String (`count_vowels.cpp`) → counted the number of vowels in a given string.  
   - GCD of Two Numbers (`gcd_two_numbers.cpp`) → implemented Euclid’s algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *Simple Expense Tracker (`expense_tracker.py`)* to manage daily expenses and calculate the total.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced **array manipulation**, **string handling**, and **mathematical operations** in C++.  
- Strengthened understanding of **loops, conditionals, and functions** across both C++ and Python.  
- Learned how to **structure a script** with functions for modularity and readability.  
- Understood the importance of **small, practical scripts** that solve real-world problems.

## Next Steps

- Solve **more string and number problems** tomorrow.  
- Add **persistence feature** to Expense Tracker (saving data to a file).  
- Keep pushing daily commits and updating the root README to track progress.
