# Day 11 – 60DaysOfCode

## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** and focused on mastering **Tree Traversal Algorithms**.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - **Inorder Traversal (`inorder_traversal.cpp`)** → visited left subtree → root → right subtree recursively.  
   - **Preorder Traversal (`preorder_traversal.cpp`)** → visited root → left → right, using a top-down approach.  
   - **Postorder Traversal (`postorder_traversal.cpp`)** → visited left → right → root for hierarchical deletion order.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *File Backup Organizer (`file_backup_organizer.py`)* that automatically creates time-stamped backups of files from one directory to another.

## Key Learnings

- Gained clear understanding of **recursive tree traversal algorithms**.  
- Learned how different traversals are used for **expression trees and deletion order**.  
- Practiced structured and readable C++ recursion logic.  
- Improved knowledge of **Python file automation and timestamp management** using `datetime`.  
- Strengthened confidence in both **DSA concepts and automation scripting**.

## Next Steps

- Begin with **Binary Search Tree (BST)** concepts and implement **Insertion and Search operations**.  
- Add compression or report generation in the backup script.  
- Keep daily progress consistent and continue documenting all learnings.
