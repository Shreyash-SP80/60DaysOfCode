# Day 10 – 60DaysOfCode

## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** and focused on understanding **Binary Trees** in depth.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:  
   - **Binary Tree Creation (`create_binary_tree.cpp`)** → implemented recursive construction of a binary tree.  
   - **Level Order Traversal (`level_order_traversal.cpp`)** → printed nodes level by level using a queue.  
   - **Reverse Level Order Traversal (`reverse_level_order.cpp`)** → displayed nodes in reverse level order using a queue and stack combination.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *Folder Organizer (`folder_cleaner.py`)* that automatically sorts files in a directory into subfolders based on their extensions.

## Key Learnings

- Gained a strong understanding of **binary tree structure**, **node relationships**, and **recursive tree building**.  
- Learned how to perform **Level Order Traversal** using a queue and **Reverse Level Order Traversal** using both a queue and stack.  
- Enhanced practical coding habits by writing clean, modular functions in C++.  
- Improved automation skills through **Python scripting** using the `os` and `shutil` modules.  
- Understood the importance of maintaining an **organized project workspace** and efficient file management.
