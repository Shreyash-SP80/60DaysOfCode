# Day 16 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 23rd October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge**.  
2. Solved **3 DSA problems in C++ related to trees**:
   - Sum of Left Leaves (`sum_of_left_leaves.cpp`) → calculated the sum of all left leaf nodes in a binary tree.  
   - Invert Binary Tree (`invert_binary_tree.cpp`) → mirrored the given binary tree recursively.  
   - Count Good Nodes (`count_good_nodes.cpp`) → counted nodes that are greater than or equal to all their ancestors.  
3. Created a **Python Git Auto Commit Script** (`git_auto_commit.py`) to automate daily progress commits and pushes to GitHub.

## Key Learnings

- Gained better understanding of **recursive tree traversal** patterns.  
- Learned how to implement **mirror operations** and **node property checks** in trees.  
- Automated **Git commit workflow** using Python to improve productivity.  
- Strengthened debugging and problem decomposition skills in C++.

## Next Steps

- Work on **Binary Search Tree (BST)** insertion, deletion, and validation problems.  
- Automate **Git pull and branch management** in the script.  
- Keep documenting and committing progress daily.
