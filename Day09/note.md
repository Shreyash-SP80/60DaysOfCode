## What I Did Today 

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** and focused on solving logical and recursive problems.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Remove Vowels from String (`remove_vowels.cpp`) → removed all vowels from a given string using conditional checks.  
   - Find Missing Number in Array (`missing_number.cpp`) → identified the missing number using the mathematical sum formula.  
   - Fibonacci Series Using Recursion (`fibonacci_recursive.cpp`) → printed the Fibonacci sequence using a simple recursive function.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *System Info Fetcher (`system_info.py`)* that displays detailed information about the operating system, machine, and processor.

## Key Learnings

- Strengthened understanding of **recursion, array manipulation, and mathematical reasoning** in C++.  
- Practiced **string filtering techniques** for data cleaning and processing.  
- Learned about Python’s **`platform` and `os` modules** for fetching system-level data.  
- Improved coding discipline by writing **modular and reusable functions**.  
- Maintained focus on **clean code practices and logical structuring** in both languages.
