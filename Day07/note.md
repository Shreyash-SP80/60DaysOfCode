# Day 07 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 9th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. **Stayed consistent** with my 60DaysOfCode challenge and pushed multiple commits today.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Second Largest Element in Array (`second_largest.cpp`) → found the second largest number efficiently using linear traversal.  
   - Count Even and Odd Numbers in Array (`count_even_odd.cpp`) → counted the number of even and odd integers.  
   - Factorial Using Recursion (`factorial_recursive.cpp`) → calculated factorials using a recursive function.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *Number Guessing Game (`number_guessing.py`)* for interactive practice with loops, conditionals, and random numbers.

## Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of **array traversal, comparison logic, and edge case handling**.  
- Practiced **recursion** in C++ for factorial computation.  
- Reinforced **loops, conditionals, and random number generation** in Python.  
- Learned to structure **interactive scripts** that can be reused and modified for different tasks.  
- Strengthened **problem-solving mindset** by combining DSA and scripting practice in a single day.

## Next Steps

- Solve **more string and array pattern problems** tomorrow.  
- Enhance Number Guessing Game to **track scores or allow multiple rounds**.  
- Continue **daily commits** and updating root README to track overall progress.
