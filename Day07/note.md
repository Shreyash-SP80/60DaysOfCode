## What I Did Today

1. **Stayed consistent** with my 60DaysOfCode challenge and pushed multiple commits today.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - Second Largest Element in Array (`second_largest.cpp`) → found the second largest number efficiently using linear traversal.  
   - Count Even and Odd Numbers in Array (`count_even_odd.cpp`) → counted the number of even and odd integers.  
   - Factorial Using Recursion (`factorial_recursive.cpp`) → calculated factorials using a recursive function.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *Number Guessing Game (`number_guessing.py`)* for interactive practice with loops, conditionals, and random numbers.
