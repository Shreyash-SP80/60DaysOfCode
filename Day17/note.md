## 🧠 What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge**.  
2. Solved **2 advanced DSA problems in C++ related to Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**
   - **95. Unique Binary Search Trees II** → Generated all structurally unique BSTs that store values `1...n` using recursion and divide-and-conquer.  
     📄 *File:* `unique_bst_ii.cpp`  
   - **96. Unique Binary Search Trees** → Calculated the number of structurally unique BSTs possible for `n` nodes using **Dynamic Programming** (Catalan numbers).  
     📄 *File:* `unique_bst_count.cpp`
3. Created a **Python System Optimization Script** to clean temporary files, clear caches, empty Recycle Bin, and monitor CPU & RAM usage.  
   📄 *File:* `optimize_laptop.py`

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Strengthened understanding of **recursive tree construction** and **combinatorial logic**.  
- Learned how **Catalan numbers** are applied in counting unique BST structures.  
- Improved my **Dynamic Programming** problem-solving ability.  
- Automated **laptop maintenance** with Python, enhancing performance and focus.  
- Practiced **structured documentation** and **clean coding habits** in both C++ and Python.

## 🧩 Code Files Overview

| Language | File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| C++ | `unique_bst_ii.cpp` | Generates all unique BSTs (Problem 95) |
| C++ | `unique_bst_count.cpp` | Counts number of unique BSTs using DP (Problem 96) |
| Python | `optimize_laptop.py` | Optimizes laptop performance by cleaning system files |

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Solve problems related to **BST validation, traversal, and balancing** (AVL / Red-Black Trees).  
- Enhance the Python script to include **battery optimization** and **startup management**.  
- Continue daily progress in the **#60DaysOfCode** challenge with consistency and automation.
