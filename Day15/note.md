# Day 15 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 19th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge**.  
2. Solved **3 DSA problems in C++ related to trees**:
   - Diameter of Binary Tree (`diameter_binary_tree.cpp`) → calculated the longest path between any two nodes.  
   - Lowest Common Ancestor (`lowest_common_ancestor.cpp`) → found the LCA of two given nodes.  
   - Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree (`max_path_sum.cpp`) → computed the maximum sum path in a binary tree.  
3. Created a **Python Daily Coding Tracker Script** (`coding_tracker.py`) to log daily coding sessions, problems solved, and notes automatically.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced **binary tree traversal techniques** and recursive problem solving.  
- Learned about **path-related tree algorithms** (diameter, max sum, LCA).  
- Improved **Python scripting** for tracking coding progress automatically.  
- Strengthened debugging skills and **tree visualization understanding**.

## Next Steps

- Explore **advanced tree problems**, including segment trees and balanced trees.  
- Optimize tree algorithms for **time and space efficiency**.  
- Continue **daily commits** and documenting DSA progress consistently.
