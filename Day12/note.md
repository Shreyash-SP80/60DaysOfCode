# Day 12 – 60DaysOfCode

## Date: 12th October 2025

## What I Did Today

1. Continued my **60DaysOfCode challenge** and focused on **Binary Tree construction and analysis**.  
2. **Solved 3 DSA problems in C++**:
   - **Build Tree from Level Order & Traversal (`build_level_order.cpp`)** → created a tree dynamically using level order input.  
   - **Count Leaf Nodes (`count_leaf_nodes.cpp`)** → recursively counted all leaf nodes in the binary tree.  
   - **Count Levels of Tree (`count_levels.cpp`)** → used level order traversal to find the number of levels (height) in the tree.  
3. **Created a Python script** – *JSON to CSV Converter (`json_to_csv_converter.py`)* to automate JSON to CSV data transformation.

## Key Learnings

- Gained deeper understanding of **tree creation (level order & recursive)** approaches.  
- Practiced **queue-based traversal** for BFS and height calculation.  
- Strengthened recursive problem-solving for **leaf node identification**.  
- Learned how to work with **JSON and CSV files** in Python for data processing.  
- Improved clarity in **I/O handling and algorithm design**.

## Next Steps

- Move forward with **Binary Search Tree (BST) insertion and search** operations.  
- Explore **serialization and deserialization** of trees.  
- Keep daily coding consistency and update GitHub progress.
